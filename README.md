Before You Begin:

Each player is given one boat and starts at the harbor of their chosen island. They choose thir mast color, and place the mast on their boat and island.
Place all barrels and canons on the resource island.

Gameplay:
Each round consists of the following steps:

Roll the Dice: Move your boat the number of steps rolled. While moving you have wind in your sails, and yuu are not able to turn around.
If you  hit another boat or harbor, you stop there even if you have rolled a higher dice number.

Engage in Combat: If your boat stops on the same waterway as another player, or you land on another players harbor, you initiate a battle (see "Battle" below).

Docking on resource island:
This island has two sides, the resource side and the canon side.
If you dock to the resource side, you can roll the dice to get up to 4 barrels with you. If you roll higher than 4, you still get 4 barrels.
If you want more barrels, you need to undock and return to the island to try your luck again.
Trade at Armory Island: Exchange 1 cannon for 3 resource barrels.
You cannot carry more than one cannon or barrel per boat slot.
If you are docked to the resource island, other players cannot initiate a battle with you.

Docking at Your Island:
Load or unload cannons and resource barrels between your boat and the dock.
Each boat slot can hold one itemâ€”either a cannon or a barrel. If you are docked to your own island, and another player initiate a battle, they will first battle your boat, then they can battle your island if they win on the same turn.

Island Battle:
You initiate a battle if you dock to another player's island.
If you loose the battle, your boat is sent back to your home harbor.
Cannons are then returned to the resource island lot. Barrels are floating on to their players harbor.
