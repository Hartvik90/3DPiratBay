A 3D-printed pirate-themed game for up to 4 players!

Game Setup:
To get started, 3D print the following models from the 3D_print/ folder:

Boats: 4 pieces
Masts: 8 pieces
Barrels: 30 pieces
Cannons: 10 pieces
Water-ways: 20 pieces
Links: 30 pieces
Islands:
  Player Island: 1 piece
  Resource Island: 1 piece

Game Rules:
Before You Begin:
Arrange 16 water ways in a circle. Use links to connect each water way piece.
Evenly space player islands around the circle and connect them using links.
Place Resource Island at the center. Connect it to the circle with 2 water ways leading to its cannon and resource ports.
Ensure Resource Island is at least 5 water ways away from any player island.

Each player is given one boat and starts at the harbor of their chosen island. They choose their mast color, and place the mast on their boat and island.
Place all barrels and cannons on the resource island.

Gameplay:
Each round consists of the following steps:

Roll the Dice: Move your boat the number of steps rolled. While moving you have wind in your sails, and you are not able to turn around.
If you  hit another boat or harbor, you stop there even if you have rolled a higher dice number.

Engage in Combat: If your boat stops on the same waterway as another player, or you land on another players harbor, you initiate a battle (see "Battle" below).

Docking on resource island:
This island has two sides, the resource side and the cannon side.
If you dock to the resource side, you can roll the dice to get up to 4 barrels with you. If you roll higher than 4, you still get 4 barrels.
If you want more barrels, you need to undock and return to the island to try your luck again.
Trade at Armory Island: Exchange 1 cannon for 3 resource barrels.
You cannot carry more than one cannon or barrel per boat slot.
If you are docked to the resource island, other players cannot initiate a battle with you.

Docking at Your Island:
Load or unload cannons and resource barrels between your boat and the dock.
Each boat slot can hold one item‚Äîeither a cannon or a barrel. If you are docked to your own island, and another player initiate a battle, they will first battle your boat, then they can battle your island if they win on the same turn.
